# More Information on Contributing to Kade Engine

## Branches
`master` is the repository's main branch, so people can clone a stable Kade Engine to work on their mods

### If your pull request changes the engine, it merges into MASTER.
### If your pull request changes the website, it merges into GH.

This really took this long to document. Why?
